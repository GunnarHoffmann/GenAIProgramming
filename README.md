This repository contains a Streamlit app that is a square guessing game. The app displays a random number between 0 and 100, and the user must guess its square.

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the App

To run the Streamlit app, execute the following command:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the app on `http://localhost:8501` by default. Open your browser and navigate to that URL to play the game.
